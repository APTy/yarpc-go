- [x] remove Lifecycle from Transport

- [ ] rename UnaryOutbound to Caller
- [ ] rename StreamOutbound to Streamer
- [ ] ClientStream, why not an interface?
- [ ] rename peer.Transport to yarpctransport.Dialer
- [ ] remove peer.Binder (lifecycle related)
- [o] make peer.ListUpdates an anonymous struct
- [x] remove deprecated peer list chooser implementation interafce
- [ ] remove "connecting" state from peer status
- [ ] debatably reduce scope of peer status to just connection status, forcing the peer list to track pending request counts directly
- [ ] remove Identifier interface from Peer interface
- [ ] strip pkg/lifecycle implementation from all component implementations
- [ ] remove Spec and Config
- [ ] rename CallStream / Stream/Streamer
- [ ] scrape pid/id
- [ ] move router to v2/yarpcrouter
- [ ] cull support for (service, procedure) mappings in map router
- [ ] NewInbound should take Listener and Router for HTTP and gRPC, TChannel too if we can pull it off
- [ ] Inbound Stop should take context instead of configured timeout
- [ ] revisit v2/yarpcraw/doc to match dispatcherless API
- [ ] remove all yarpc.RegisterClientBuilder
- [ ] revisit yarpcraw.New, return concrete *Client type instead of interface
- [ ] revisit v2/doc.go for package description that encompasses subpackages
- [x] remove lifecycle from v2/yarpcpeerlist
- [ ] fix tests in roundrobin and peerlist action tests
- [ ] merge *test
- [x] yarpc/peer.Transport -> yarpc/v2.Dialer
- [ ] yarpc/peer.Identifier -> yarpc/v2.PeerIdentifier
- [ ] yarpc/peer.Status -> yarpc/v2.PeerStatus
- [ ] yarpc/peer.Single -> self-choosing-peers
      have all transport peer implementations implement peer.Chooser so they can be retained and passed manually to a client constructor
- [ ] audit errors.go for peer list errors regarding start/stop events
- [ ] add doc back to v2/yarpcpeer which now is reduced to just the AbstractPeer implementation
- [ ] remove transport argument from yarpc/v2/yarpcpeer.NewAbstractPeer previously yarpc/hostport.NewPeer
- [ ] bring back NewSingleOutbound
- [ ] consolidate mocks in*test into v2/yarpctest
- [ ] yarpc.Dialer more like Dialer (Dial(ctx, id) Closer instead of RetainPeer and ReleasePeer)
- [ ] replace TransportAction with DialerAction throughout
- [ ] rewrite v2/yarpcroundrobin tests
- [ ] type Error error to collate errors in godoc
- [x] http new inbound takes a listener and a router
- [x] http shutdown is now public
- [ ] revisit all Start/Stop to thread a context
- [ ] add dialer options for http dialer
- [ ] revisit ErrTransportHasNoReferenceToPeer error, maybe get rid of it, definitely rename TransportName, maybe privatize it.
- [ ] http inbound accepts listener
  - [ ] revisit i.server.Serve to run in a goroutine and preserve internal/net semantics
- [ ] move ValidateRequest into yarpctransport package
- [ ] replace client config provider with a register/get API in YARPC Fx that connects the configuration of individual transports.
- [ ] rename handler specs returned by routers to routes
- [ ] moved internal/yarpcerrors.WrapHandlerErrort to v2/yarpcerrors
- [ ] rename yarpcerrors to yarpcerror in keeping with the aesthetic
