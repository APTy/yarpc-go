- [ ] merge *test
- [x] yarpc/peer.Transport -> yarpc/v2.Dialer
- [ ] yarpc/peer.Identifier -> yarpc/v2.PeerIdentifier
- [ ] yarpc/peer.Status -> yarpc/v2.PeerStatus
-     replace NewSingleOutbound with &Outbound{Dialer, Addr/URL} pattern for all transports.
      - [x] HTTP
      - [ ] TChannel
      - [ ] gRPC
- [ ] audit errors.go for peer list errors regarding start/stop events
- [ ] add doc back to v2/yarpcpeer which now is reduced to just the AbstractPeer implementation
- [ ] remove transport argument from yarpc/v2/yarpcpeer.NewAbstractPeer previously yarpc/hostport.NewPeer
- [ ] consolidate mocks in*test into v2/yarpctest
- [ ] yarpc.Dialer more like Dialer (Dial(ctx, id) Closer instead of RetainPeer and ReleasePeer)
- [ ] replace TransportAction with DialerAction throughout
- [ ] rewrite v2/yarpcroundrobin tests
- [ ] type Error error to collate errors in godoc

- [x] http shutdown is now public
- [ ] revisit all Start/Stop to thread a context
- [ ] add dialer options for http dialer
- [ ] revisit ErrTransportHasNoReferenceToPeer error, maybe get rid of it, definitely rename TransportName, maybe privatize it.
- [ ] http inbound accepts listener
  - [ ] revisit i.server.Serve to run in a goroutine and preserve internal/net semantics
- [ ] move ValidateRequest into yarpctransport package
- [ ] replace client config provider with a register/get API in YARPC Fx that connects the configuration of individual transports.
- [x] moved internal/yarpcerrors.WrapHandlerError to v2/yarpcerrors
- [x] rename yarpcerrors to yarpcerror in keeping with the aesthetic (this also reveals accidental linkage to the prior version)
- [x] Replace ClientConfig, OutboundConfig, and Outbounds -> yarpc.Client{Caller,Service,Unary,Stream}
- [ ] audit v2/yarpctransport error types for actual usage and naming
