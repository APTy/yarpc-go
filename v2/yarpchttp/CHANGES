- [x] intyarpcerrors yarpc/internal/yarpcerrors -> yarpc/v2/internal/internalyarpcerrors
- [x] remove YARPC yarpc.* documentation stutter, since the package name has changed.
- [x] thread router through NewInbound, remove SetRouter
- [x] port dispatcher-based examples and tests
- [x] encoding/raw -> v2/yarpcraw
- [x] yarpcraw.Encoding -> yarpc.Encoding("raw") in tests to decouple raw package

- [x] Outbound Start/Stop lifecycle no longer drives chooser Start/Stop lifecycle.
      [x] consequently, outbound no longer needs to implement Start/Stop lifecycle.
      [x] tests fixed to not use lifecycle
- [x] reg as a free variable -> router
- [x] moved internal internal/errors.ZeroAddrToHostPort to v2/internal/internalyarpcerrors
- [x] decouple NewInbound from NewTransport
- [x] decouple NewOutbound from NewTransport (except NewSingleOutbound)
- [x] transport -> dialer everywhere
- [x] move the connectorsGroup.Done() method into a defer block to ensure the dialer.Stop() returns, even if NotifyStatusChanged (particularly on a mock) panics.

- [x] remove Lifecycle from Inbound
- [ ] fix options pattern
  - [x] change NewTransport constructor with options pattern to &Dialer{} struct
  - [x] change NewInbound constructor with options pattern to &Inbound{} struct
  - [x] change NewOutbound constructor with options pattern to &Outbound{} struct
- [x] Inbound struct now configured with Addr or Listener, exposed Listener property is API for getting Addr()
- [x] exorcise ClientConfig interface in favor of OutboundConfig struct
- [x] thread context through Start/Stop
- [x] revisit yarpc.ErrTansportHsNoReferenceToPeer -> yarpcerrors.ErrDialerHasNoReferenceToPeer
