// The API package is for all interfaces and patterns that need to be
// implemented to interact with the yarpctest api, but not the explicit types
// we'll use to make requests, or the types that we'll use directly in tests.
//
// The purpose of this sub-package is to reduce the information that needs to be
// provided at the top-level yarpctest package.
